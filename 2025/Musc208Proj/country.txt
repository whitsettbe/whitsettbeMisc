Style: [Country, acoustic guitar, male voice, storytelling lyrics, heartfelt melody]
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
The sun fades slow on an old dirt road
Dust kicks up where the memories go
Got a worn-out map and a heart full of sin
Chasing your shadow like whiskey on the wind

[Chorus]
Whiskey on the wind, gone before the night
Took my love and left me standing in the fading light
Ain’t no bottle strong enough to bring you back again
Guess I’ll keep on chasing like whiskey on the wind

[Verse 2]
Neon signs and a jukebox tune
A barstool feels like home too soon
Every sip just brings me back to then
Still hear your laughter like whiskey on the wind

[Chorus]
Whiskey on the wind, gone before the night
Took my love and left me standing in the fading light
Ain’t no bottle strong enough to bring you back again
Guess I’ll keep on chasing like whiskey on the wind

[Bridge]
Maybe someday I’ll find my peace
But tonight, your memory won’t let me be

[Outro]
So I’ll raise a glass and let it spin
Lost in the night like whiskey on the wind
