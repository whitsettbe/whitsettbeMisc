Lyrics:

[Intro, Funky Guitar, Synth Stabs]
(Oooh yeah, let’s dance!)
(Ahh-ahh, feel the groove now!)

[Verse 1]
The mirror ball is shining bright
Neon colors in the flashing lights
Feel the rhythm, move your feet
Let the music set you free

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooooh, let your body sway
Lose yourself, don’t hesitate
Hands up high, let’s celebrate
Tonight’s the night, don’t make me wait!

[Chorus, Funky Bass Drop]
Dancing through the night, oh-oh!
Spinning till the morning light, oh-oh!
Feel the fever, let it rise
We’re electrified tonight!

[Verse 2]
Heartbeat racing to the sound
Every step is magic now
Golden sparkles in the air
Come on, baby, take me there

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooooh, let your body sway
Lose yourself, don’t hesitate
Hands up high, let’s celebrate
Tonight’s the night, don’t make me wait!

[Chorus, Funky Bass Drop]
Dancing through the night, oh-oh!
Spinning till the morning light, oh-oh!
Feel the fever, let it rise
We’re electrified tonight!

[Bridge, Instrumental Break, Sax Solo]
(Yeah, come on! Woo!)

[Outro, Group Vocals, Disco Claps]
Keep on moving, don’t stop now
One more dance, let’s break it down
We got the groove, we got the sound
Disco fever’s all around!
