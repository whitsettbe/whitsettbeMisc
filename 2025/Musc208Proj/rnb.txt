Lyrics:

[Intro, Soft piano, Gentle harmonies]
Ooooh, yeah, yeah…
Mmm, under the moonlight…

[Verse 1]
Soft whispers in the dark, your touch ignites a spark
Every moment here with you, feels like a dream come true
Your heartbeat next to mine, moving slow in perfect time
Got me lost inside your eyes, no place I'd rather hide

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooooh, can you feel it?
The way our souls collide, no need to fight it
Let the rhythm pull us closer, side by side

[Chorus, Soaring vocals, Emotional harmonies]
Love in the moonlight, shining so bright
Wrapped in your arms, everything feels right
No need to rush, just take your time
Tonight, you’re mine, love in the moonlight

[Verse 2]
Soft kisses trace my skin, pulling me deeper in
Your hands know just the way, to make me wanna stay
Every sigh, every touch, baby, I can’t get enough
Underneath the silver glow, let’s lose control

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooooh, can you feel it?
The way our souls collide, no need to fight it
Let the rhythm pull us closer, side by side

[Chorus, Stronger harmonies, Melodic ad-libs]
Love in the moonlight, shining so bright
Wrapped in your arms, everything feels right
No need to rush, just take your time
Tonight, you’re mine, love in the moonlight

[Bridge, Emotional build-up, Subtle strings]
Ooooh, don’t wake me up if this is a dream
I wanna stay right here, just you and me
The stars above, they know our name
Love like this will never fade

[Chorus, Final, Passionate delivery]
Love in the moonlight, shining so bright
Wrapped in your arms, everything feels right
No need to rush, just take your time
Tonight, you’re mine, love in the moonlight
