Style: [Folk, acoustic guitar, warm male vocals, storytelling ballad]
Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
The sun peeks over rolling hills
A golden glow, the air so still
I tie my boots, I pack my load
Another step on wandering roads

[Chorus]
Oh, the wind it calls my name
Through valleys deep and skies aflame
I walk alone, yet never stray
The road will always show the way

[Verse 2]
A river sings a melody
Soft whispers through the willow trees
I pause to drink, to rest my bones
Then carry on to lands unknown

[Chorus]
Oh, the wind it calls my name
Through valleys deep and skies aflame
I walk alone, yet never stray
The road will always show the way

[Bridge]
Through dusty towns and mountain high
With every step, I feel alive
No place to go, no place to stay
Just chasing dreams that fade away

[Chorus]
Oh, the wind it calls my name
Through valleys deep and skies aflame
I walk alone, yet never stray
The road will always show the way

[Outro]
And when my time has reached its end
I'll find my peace with earth again
A travelerâ€™s heart, forever free
The road will always carry me
