Lyrics:

[Intro, Soft Rhodes Piano]
Mmm… yeah… ohhh, ohhh...
Feels like a dream, but I’m wide awake...

[Verse 1]
Every touch, every glance, sets my heart on fire
You pull me close, and I get lost in desire
Whispered words, like a melody so sweet
Got me floating, babe, I can’t feel my feet

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, the way you love me, takes me higher
Like the stars above, burning brighter
[Chorus, Soulful Harmonies]
I’m lost in your love, don’t wanna be found
Drownin’ in the way that you pull me down
Every heartbeat, every sigh
Baby, you and I, we’re touchin’ the sky

[Verse 2]
Golden light in your eyes when you say my name
Feels like heaven, wrapped up in your embrace
I don’t need no map, no way back home
You’re my shelter, my peace, my song

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, the way you love me, takes me higher
Like the stars above, burning brighter

[Chorus, Soulful Harmonies]
I’m lost in your love, don’t wanna be found
Drownin’ in the way that you pull me down
Every heartbeat, every sigh
Baby, you and I, we’re touchin’ the sky

[Bridge, Emotional Guitar Solo]
Ooooh, ohh, I’ll never run, I’ll never hide
Got my soul wrapped up in you tonight

[Outro, Gentle Piano & Fading Harmonies]
Mmm… yeah… ohhh, ohhh...
Feels like a dream, but I’m wide awake...
