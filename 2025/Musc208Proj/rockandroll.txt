Title: Born to Run Wild
Style: [High-energy rock and roll, electric guitar riffs, powerful male vocals, driving drum beats]
Lyrics:

[Intro, Electric Guitar Riff]
(Yeahhh, let's go!)

[Verse 1]
Foot on the gas, wind in my hair
Ain’t got no worries, ain't got a care
Burnin’ rubber, chasin’ the night
Freedom's callin’, feelin’ alright

[Pre-Chorus]
Guitar screamin’, stars light the way
Ain’t lookin’ back, I was born to stray

[Chorus]
I was born to run wild, never slowin’ down
Turn the radio up, feel the thunder sound
No chains can hold me, no ties can bind
I was born to run wild, leave it all behind

[Verse 2]
Roarin’ engine, fire in my soul
Another city, another road to roll
Heart like lightning, can’t be tamed
Got a hunger that can't be named

[Pre-Chorus]
Guitar screamin’, stars light the way
Ain’t lookin’ back, I was born to stray

[Chorus]
I was born to run wild, never slowin’ down
Turn the radio up, feel the thunder sound
No chains can hold me, no ties can bind
I was born to run wild, leave it all behind

[Guitar Solo, High-Energy]

[Bridge]
Ain't no limits, ain't no fears
Just the open road and shifting gears
Let ‘em chase me, let ‘em try
I’ll be gone before goodbye

[Chorus]
I was born to run wild, never slowin’ down
Turn the radio up, feel the thunder sound
No chains can hold me, no ties can bind
I was born to run wild, leave it all behind

[Outro, Fading Guitar Solo]
(Yeahhh, keep on runnin’… no turnin’ back…)
