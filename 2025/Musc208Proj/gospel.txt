Lyrics:

[Intro, Gentle Piano, Soft Choir]
Oh Lord, I call Your name
In the darkness, You're my flame

[Verse 1]
When the night feels cold and long
You’re the light that keeps me strong
Through the storm, through the rain
You’re my shelter, You remain

[Pre-Chorus, Rising Harmony]
Oh, I know, I’m never alone
Through the fire, You lead me home

[Chorus, Full Choir, Uplifting]
Lift me up, Lord, lift me high
With Your love, I touch the sky
Break these chains, set me free
By Your grace, I will believe

[Verse 2]
Every tear, You understand
Every trial, it’s in Your hands
Though I stumble, though I fall
You still hear me when I call

[Pre-Chorus, Powerful Vocals]
Oh, I know, I’m never alone
Through the fire, You lead me home

[Chorus, Full Choir, Handclaps]
Lift me up, Lord, lift me high
With Your love, I touch the sky
Break these chains, set me free
By Your grace, I will believe

[Bridge, Soulful Choir, Call & Response]
(Hallelujah) You are mighty, You are strong
(Hallelujah) In Your arms, I belong
(Hallelujah) Every breath, every song
(Hallelujah) Lord, I lift Your name on high

[Chorus, Grand Finale, Full Band]
Lift me up, Lord, lift me high
With Your love, I touch the sky
Break these chains, set me free
By Your grace, I will believe

[Outro, Gentle Piano, Fading Choir]
Oh Lord, I call Your name
In the darkness, You remain
