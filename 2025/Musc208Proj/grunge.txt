Title: Fading Echoes
Style: [Grunge, distorted guitars, raw vocals, heavy drums, melancholic yet aggressive tone]
Lyrics:

[Intro, Distorted Guitar Riff]
(Static hum, feedback screech)
Shadows crawl across my mind,
Fading echoes left behind.

[Verse 1]
Woke up drowning in the haze,
Same old nightmares, different days.
Broken mirror, bloodshot eyes,
Truth is tangled up in lies.

[Pre-Chorus]
(Whispered) I can't feel, I can't breathe...
(Screamed) Is this all that's left of me?!

[Chorus, Heavy Drums]
I'm falling deeper, sinking slow,
Lost inside this undertow.
Scream my name, but no one hears,
Drowning in a sea of fears.

[Verse 2]
Cigarette burns on my skin,
Just to prove I’m real again.
Echoes laughing in my head,
I keep talking to the dead.

[Pre-Chorus]
(Whispered) I can't feel, I can't breathe...
(Screamed) Is this all that's left of me?!

[Chorus, Heavy Drums]
I'm falling deeper, sinking slow,
Lost inside this undertow.
Scream my name, but no one hears,
Drowning in a sea of fears.

[Bridge, Fuzzy Guitar Solo]
(Ahh ahh ahh…)
Do you see me? Do you care?
Or am I just fading air?

[Outro, Slow Fade]
Shadows crawl across my mind,
Fading echoes left behind...
