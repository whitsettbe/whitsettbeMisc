Style: [Smooth jazz, soulful saxophone, soft piano, warm double bass, velvety vocals]
Lyrics:

[Intro, Soft Piano, Saxophone]
(Mmm… oh yeah…)

[Verse 1]
City lights are glowing, painting gold on midnight blue
Footsteps softly echo, like a waltz between us two
The air is cool and tender, like your whispers in my ear
Every note of this old record takes me somewhere near

[Chorus, Velvety Vocals, Jazz Swing]
So dance with me, under silver skies
Let the rhythm take us where the heart complies
No words are needed, just a touch will do
In this midnight serenade, I'm lost in you

[Instrumental Interlude, Saxophone Solo]

[Verse 2]
Fingers trace the table, playing chords upon the wine
Laughter lingers sweetly, like a melody divine
Every glance is music, every sigh a soft refrain
Darling, let’s just stay right here and play this tune again

[Chorus, Soulful Harmonies]
So dance with me, under silver skies
Let the rhythm take us where the heart complies
No words are needed, just a touch will do
In this midnight serenade, I'm lost in you

[Bridge, Dreamy Guitar, Whispered Vocals]
Time slows down when you're near
Like a lullaby so clear
Let the moonlight write our song
While we sway all night long

[Outro, Soft Piano, Saxophone Fade]
(Mmm… just you and me…)
(In this midnight serenade…)
