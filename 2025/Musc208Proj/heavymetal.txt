Style: [Heavy metal, aggressive riffs, deep growling vocals, double bass drumming, dark atmosphere]
Lyrics:

[Intro, Dark Guitar Riff]
(The shadows rise... from the abyss...)

[Verse 1]
Raging fire burns in the sky
Echoes of torment, the fallen cry
Blackened steel, the blood runs cold
A tale of vengeance, a fate foretold

[Pre-Chorus]
Through the chaos, through the night
We stand alone, ready to fight

[Chorus, Powerful Vocals]
Shadows of the abyss, calling my name
Breaking the chains, igniting the flame
No turning back, no fear remains
Darkness will bow as we conquer the pain

[Verse 2]
Cursed by demons, bound in chains
Yet I rise, defying fate
Through the storm, through the hell
The war drums pound, hear the knell

[Pre-Chorus]
Through the chaos, through the night
We stand alone, ready to fight

[Chorus, Powerful Vocals]
Shadows of the abyss, calling my name
Breaking the chains, igniting the flame
No turning back, no fear remains
Darkness will bow as we conquer the pain

[Guitar Solo, Shredding Madness]

[Bridge, Heavy Breakdown]
(Deep growls)
Burn it down! Crush the lies!
We will rise! We will rise!

[Chorus, Final Roar]
Shadows of the abyss, calling my name
Breaking the chains, igniting the flame
No turning back, no fear remains
Darkness will bow as we conquer the pain

[Outro, Fading Distorted Guitar]
(The shadows fade... into the abyss...)
