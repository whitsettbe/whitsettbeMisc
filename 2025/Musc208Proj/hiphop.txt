Title: Rise to the Top
Style: [Hip Hop, Boom Bap Beats, Male Rap, Gritty Flow]
Lyrics:

[Intro, Slow Beat Drop]
Yeah, yeah, uh
Started from the bottom, now we risin’ up
Ain’t no lookin’ back, we just light it up

[Verse 1]
Came from the struggle, had to grind for the dream
Late nights, no sleep, just a mic and a scheme
Every loss, every fall, made me stronger than steel
Now I’m standin’ on my own, got my hands on the wheel

[Pre-Chorus]
Never had a silver plate, had to make my own way
Now they see me comin’ up, got ‘em speechless, no say
From the pain to the wins, every step got a cost
But I knew I’d see the top, I ain't takin’ no loss

[Chorus, Heavy Bass Drop]
We rise, we shine, never backin’ down
Built this fire from the ashes, now we run the town
They tried to stop me, but I broke through the chains
Now I’m standin’ in the light while they stuck in the rain

[Verse 2]
Used to dream in the dark, now my vision is clear
Took the hate, turned it gold, made my name in a year
Every verse, every line, put my soul in the sound
Now they chantin’ my name when I step in the crowd

[Bridge, Melodic Hook]
Ooooh, I know where I came from
Ooooh, but I ain’t goin’ back now
Ooooh, put my city on my back
Ain’t no stoppin’, ain't no slack

[Chorus, Heavy Bass Drop]
We rise, we shine, never backin’ down
Built this fire from the ashes, now we run the town
They tried to stop me, but I broke through the chains
Now I’m standin’ in the light while they stuck in the rain

[Outro, Fading Beat]
Yeah, yeah, we risin’ up
Ain’t no lookin’ back, we just light it up
