Title: Midnight Blues
Style: [Classic blues, slow 12-bar progression, soulful male vocals, wailing guitar solos]
Lyrics:

[Intro, Slow Blues Guitar]
(Mm-mm, yeah, oh-oh-oh...)

[Verse 1]
Been walkin’ these streets since the sun went down
Ain’t got no place, just wanderin’ ‘round
Moonlight’s shinin’, but it don’t feel right
Got a heavy heart in the dead of night

[Chorus]
Oh, I got them midnight blues, yeah
Ain’t nothin’ left to lose, no
Whiskey in my hand, tears on my shoes
Ain’t no cure for these midnight blues

[Verse 2]
Used to have a love, she slipped away
Took my soul with her that lonesome day
Now the wind keeps whisperin’ her name so low
Like a ghost that won’t let me go

[Chorus]
Oh, I got them midnight blues, yeah
Ain’t nothin’ left to lose, no
Whiskey in my hand, tears on my shoes
Ain’t no cure for these midnight blues

[Guitar Solo, Crying Notes]

[Bridge]
The neon lights, they flicker and fade
Just like my dreams, washed away in the rain
Lord, if you hear me, send me a sign
‘Cause I can’t shake this pain of mine

[Chorus, Full Band Swell]
Oh, I got them midnight blues, yeah
Ain’t nothin’ left to lose, no
Whiskey in my hand, tears on my shoes
Ain’t no cure for these midnight blues

[Outro, Soft Guitar Fade]
(Mm-mm, yeah, midnight blues...)
