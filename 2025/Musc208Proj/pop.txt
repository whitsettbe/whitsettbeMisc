Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
City lights are shining bright
But all I see is you tonight
Heart is racing, feels so right
Underneath the neon sky

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, the rhythm pulls us closer
Feel the magic taking over
Let the moment last forever
We don’t ever wanna stop

[Chorus]
We’re dancing in the moonlight
Spinning till the sunrise
Holding on so tight
Like we’ll never say goodbye
Oh-oh, hearts are beating in time
Oh-oh, lost in love, you and I

[Verse 2]
Shadows play upon the sand
Fingertips, a soft command
Every step, a love so grand
Take my hand, don’t let go

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, the rhythm pulls us closer
Feel the magic taking over
Let the moment last forever
We don’t ever wanna stop

[Chorus]
We’re dancing in the moonlight
Spinning till the sunrise
Holding on so tight
Like we’ll never say goodbye
Oh-oh, hearts are beating in time
Oh-oh, lost in love, you and I

[Bridge]
No more worries, no more fears
Just the music in our ears
Feel the stars, they shine so clear
Tonight is ours to keep

[Chorus]
We’re dancing in the moonlight
Spinning till the sunrise
Holding on so tight
Like we’ll never say goodbye
Oh-oh, hearts are beating in time
Oh-oh, lost in love, you and I

[Outro]
So let’s dance, don’t let go
Underneath the silver glow
Every heartbeat, every sigh
Dancing till the end of time
