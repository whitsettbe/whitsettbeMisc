Title: Edge of the Night
Style: [Contemporary Rock, electric guitars, driving drums, powerful male vocals]
Lyrics:

[Intro, Electric Guitar Riff]
(Yeah, oh-oh)

[Verse 1]
City lights flicker like a fading dream
Footsteps echo down an empty street
Shadows stretch under neon beams
Chasing ghosts that I can’t defeat

[Pre-Chorus]
I hear the whispers in the cold night air
Calling me back, but I don’t know where

[Chorus, Anthemic Guitars]
I’m standing on the edge of the night
Caught between the dark and the light
If I take one step, will I fall or fly?
I’m holding on, but I don’t know why

[Verse 2]
Lost in a moment, the past and the pain
Every mistake like a scar remains
But I won’t break, I won’t fade away
Gotta find a reason to stay

[Pre-Chorus]
I hear the whispers in the cold night air
Calling me back, but I don’t know where

[Chorus, Anthemic Guitars]
I’m standing on the edge of the night
Caught between the dark and the light
If I take one step, will I fall or fly?
I’m holding on, but I don’t know why

[Bridge, Soaring Guitar Solo]
(Oooh, yeah!)
One more chance, one last fight
One last hope to make it right

[Chorus, Power Vocals]
I’m standing on the edge of the night
Caught between the dark and the light
If I take one step, will I fall or fly?
I’m holding on, but I don’t know why

[Outro, Fading Instrumental]
Yeah, yeah… the edge of the night…
