Title: Rebel Heart
Style: [Punk rock, fast-paced guitars, aggressive drums, raw male vocals]
Lyrics:

[Intro, Distorted Guitar]
Yeah!
One, two, three, four!

[Verse 1]
I wake up to a world on fire
Lies and chains, they’re stacking higher
But I ain't gonna play their game
I was born to break the frame

[Pre-Chorus]
They tell me, “Sit down, shut up, behave”
But I’d rather rot in a shallow grave

[Chorus]
I got a rebel heart, I won’t back down
Fist in the air, I own this town
No more silence, hear my sound
I’ll scream ‘til they tear me down

[Verse 2]
Every rule’s just meant to break
Every lie’s a chance to wake
They say we’re young, they say we’re lost
But they don’t know the lines we’ve crossed

[Pre-Chorus]
They tell me, “Sit down, shut up, behave”
But I’d rather rot in a shallow grave

[Chorus]
I got a rebel heart, I won’t back down
Fist in the air, I own this town
No more silence, hear my sound
I’ll scream ‘til they tear me down

[Bridge, Gang Vocals]
(Whoa-oh-oh!)
We won’t stop, we won’t kneel!
(Whoa-oh-oh!)
We got scars, but we still feel!
(Whoa-oh-oh!)
This is our time, this is real!

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
I got a rebel heart, I won’t back down
Fist in the air, I own this town
No more silence, hear my sound
I’ll scream ‘til they tear me down

[Outro, Heavy Drums]
Yeah!
We’ll scream ‘til they tear us down!
