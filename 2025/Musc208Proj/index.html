                ['Folk', 'Wandering Roads', 'folk, acoustic guitar, warm male vocals, storytelling ballad', 'https://file.aisonggenerator.ai/4b701a6f-63fe-4cd3-8269-885e3b8c5b6a.mp3', 'https://file.aisonggenerator.ai/916ff82f-af2c-4cb8-bccc-6cb24e7593b8.mp3', 'In folk music, we typically expect a lone singer with perhaps a small collection of supporting acoustic instruments. Both of these versions show larger instrumentations than we would expect, especially during the choruses, with some electronic voices prevalent near the ends of both tracks. We do notice ties between this song and typical characteristics of the country genre, including the occasional southern "drawl" from the singer of V1, but also the general textual focus on travel and freedom.'],
                ['Gospel', 'Lift Me Up, Lord', 'gospel, soulful choir, uplifting piano, powerful vocals', 'https://file.aisonggenerator.ai/a2b149c8-ba96-42ba-9cf2-fbd846f79000.mp3', 'https://file.aisonggenerator.ai/af15d602-39bc-4b04-b7e1-2ec32fb7bfbe.mp3', 'The first version makes use of a supporting gospel choir, as if from an AME church, but then "forgets" about this element after the lead singer starts. The electric guitar and electric percussive effects are also more prominent than we might expect. The second version has no prominent electric guitar, but maintains significant electric percussion. The balance also seems off - with the approximations of vocal rapture almost covered up by the instrumentation, obscuring a hallmark effect of the genre.'],
                ['Country', 'Whiskey on the Wind', 'country, acoustic guitar, male voice, storytelling lyrics, heartfelt melody', 'https://file.aisonggenerator.ai/14181d6d-9d5c-42da-a9e0-e761c46a4682.mp3', 'https://file.aisonggenerator.ai/309c2871-059c-4c04-b818-d2e0ab1a292a.mp3', 'The fiddle introduction to the first version is unmistakably country from the first moment of the song, followed by a stereotypical country singer\'s voice - white, male, southern. The subject matter of alcohol, wandering, and lost love is extremely typical of the country genre, but not even to the point of cliche - much of the country genre reuses these tropes in the same capacity as this song does. It is interesting that the generic patterns of the AI-generated songs so convincingly produce country material, and perhaps a statement about how ingrained are the images, styles, and stereotypes of country music.'],
                ['Blues', 'Midnight Blues', 'classic blues, slow 12-bar progression, soulful male vocals, wailing guitar solos', 'https://file.aisonggenerator.ai/3c053305-0863-408e-8daa-574a1128a279.mp3', 'https://file.aisonggenerator.ai/2b7f8f1d-bf46-459b-b6d0-c63ca3229c67.mp3', 'This continues the pattern of generated songs being bent towards modern instrumentation from their classical counterparts, with a prominent electric guitar. Interestingly, the "12-bar progression" tag generated with the lyrics (in four-line verses, curiously) seems an outright lie about the model\'s capabilities - careful counting reveals a 16-bar progression! It is as though the algorithm was trained almost exclusively on songs with 4/4 16-bar metric structure, and is thus unable to reproduce a core component of the blues even when it expresses "knowledge" of this metric pattern.'],
                ['Jazz', 'Midnight Serenade', 'smooth jazz, soulful saxophone, soft piano, warm double bass, velvety vocals', 'https://file.aisonggenerator.ai/829f74f4-c4a9-4558-b656-bcde649d735f.mp3', 'https://file.aisonggenerator.ai/0dddd37e-0569-4c20-8a85-ff3aa3864b56.mp3', 'The piano and bass carry well throughout the tracks with interspersed instrumental solos by the saxophone - the kind of structure we would expect of a jazz piece. One bothersome point is the near-polyphony which <i>almost</i> starts around 1:50 in the first version, showing a possible weakness of the model in handling multiple simultaneous melodies. The second version seems to do better in this regard, weaving the saxophone and piano between vocal lines with a bit more care. However, the heavily-produced vocal effects at the end of the second version seem a bit uncharacteristic.'],
                ['RnB', 'Love in the Moonlight', 'smooth r&b, soulful vocals, deep bass, mellow keys, slow groove', 'https://file.aisonggenerator.ai/22ce9587-34ad-4050-9c14-9656c229f099.mp3', 'https://file.aisonggenerator.ai/344e74f6-0fc6-4d41-8d3e-5cd099ffb71c.mp3', 'It is interesting to note the female vocalists in both of these tracks, a more inclusive aspect of the modern interpretational angle on these genres. Although for many genres a male vocalist is assumed by the model, for RnB female voices are prominent. Of course it is difficult to break down relationships with a catch-all genre term like "RnB," having displaced the prior generic term "Race Records," but it is fair to say that these songs do not sound like Blues, Jazz, or an immediate precursor of Rock and Roll. The historical complexity has been lost in favor of a contemporary lexical interpretation.'],
                ['Rock and Roll', 'Born to Run Wild', 'high-energy rock and roll, electric guitar riffs, powerful male vocals, driving drum beats', 'https://file.aisonggenerator.ai/066ffce6-ab2f-4b79-a444-4f59f759a560.mp3', 'https://file.aisonggenerator.ai/90a6e134-0173-4292-af11-5aa47bf6e32f.mp3', 'Right at the beginning of both versions, I am surprised to hear that the model is incapable of recognizing the homonym "wind," pronouncing it as in "to wind" even given the context "wind <i>in my hair</i>." It is interesting to hear the different interpretations of the two versions, with the second much more upbeat than the first but also allowing the vocals to lag behind the beat a bit more - a compound stylistic effect the model believes befitting of the rock and roll genre, at least within its contemporarily-scoped interpretation. The instrumentals aligned with the tags and were befitting of the genre, with appropriately-executed "power" in the vocals.'],
                ['Soul', 'Lost in Your Love', 'soul, smooth bassline, warm rhodes piano, expressive male vocals, emotional backup harmonies', 'https://file.aisonggenerator.ai/32e14de6-69de-4757-a820-9794a15eb500.mp3', 'https://file.aisonggenerator.ai/b28f1a45-e4b4-4f19-9583-da3dd34feb64.mp3', 'Admittedly I don\'t have much context for the modern meaning of "soul," and I was rather expecting something more similar in style to the artist of Motown and Stax records from the \'50s. The instrumentals lack the rhythmic complexity of Motown\'s in-house band "The Funk Brothers," especially in percussion, and the vocals lack the intensity which was a rather common in artists under the Stax label. Instead the instrumentation is unobtrusive and rhythmically simple, with produced vocal effects that lend some textural intensity without significant stressing of the underlying lead vocals.'],
                ['Disco', 'Dancing Through the Night', 'funky basslines, groovy guitar, four-on-the-floor beats, soulful vocals, retro synths, disco vibes', 'https://file.aisonggenerator.ai/a327f8a2-72b3-4224-8990-85d59a77d5b2.mp3', 'https://file.aisonggenerator.ai/4c7db398-f738-4c6e-8003-d6c3da4da284.mp3', 'These tracks are upbeat with a large focus on the instrumentals. There is no use of the common string-orchestral support prevalent in much of disco music. One giveaway as to the disco nature of the song - disco is called out in the lyrics! Although this leads to a natural question - how well would this song be recognized as disco without the explicit reference? In the case of the second version, the association might be rather weak. The lone female voice, soft with occasional cry breaks, would fit more directly into the modern pop genre than into disco, although I struggle to pin down exactly what emotional quality disagrees with my expectations.'],
                ['Heavy Metal', 'Shadows of the Abyss', 'heavy metal, aggressive riffs, deep growling vocals, double bass drumming, dark atmosphere', 'https://file.aisonggenerator.ai/664d8c73-79a3-446b-87b2-e3ac214ccac1.mp3', 'https://file.aisonggenerator.ai/e820bf9d-a434-4afc-b209-7bb7cefb3f5f.mp3', 'We must address the elephant in the room: the lead singer in version 1 sounds like Hugh Jackman. This song sounds as though it could have come right out of "The Greatest Showman," like Broadway using the Heavy Metal trope rather than the authentic stream. But admittedly, the Broadway-esque nature fades by the end of the track, once the rougher chorus becomes the dominant voice. The second version definitely protrays the vocal intensity and hoarse-throated screams expected of the genre. However, it gives an unfortunately significant presence to the lyrics, letting one notice just how little is actually said through them. It is hard to pin down a coherent collection of images to characterize the song, and it seems a generic summary of the entire Heavy Metal genre rather than an example from it. Interestingly, the second version starts mid-note and ends on the beginning of what we can only assume is a new song, as though the track came right out of a concert recording.'],
                ['Punk Rock', 'Rebel Heart', 'punk rock, fast-paced guitars, aggressive drums, raw male vocals', 'https://file.aisonggenerator.ai/b757a32f-1014-4d7b-914c-934023df6af0.mp3', 'https://file.aisonggenerator.ai/d2fdef9e-322d-4bda-b998-7734efb84d33.mp3', 'The lyrics definitely convey a general sense of discontentedness with societal structure, as befitting the genre, and is written from the perspective of someone perceived as young. Beyond this, though, a similar issue is encountered from the Heavy Metal track - the lyrics don\'t say anything substantive! The playful rhythm is almost childish, musically the song seems more befitting of an elementary-school dance than a legitimate concert. The second version has a less playful rhythm and avoids this issue. In fact, without the delegitimization of childishness, the lack of concrete subject matter almost makes the song seem befitting of an FM radio station wanting to use Punk but not draw any controversy.'],
                ['Grunge', 'Fading Echoes', 'grunge, distorted guitars, raw vocals, heavy drums, melancholic yet aggressive toe', 'https://file.aisonggenerator.ai/76a029e1-b755-48bc-9eb7-b6dfe162b71e.mp3', 'https://file.aisonggenerator.ai/2df09e8c-79bc-4a1e-aef1-f5b6541107c7.mp3', 'Lyrically, this song actually maintains a self-consistent set of imagery, drawing from senses of depression, self-harm, and feelings of isolation. The vocals are successfully made raw, with a significant scraping quality. The second version even starts with the lead vocal filtered by some sort of low-fidelity digital conversion, as though speaking through a telephone or poor television signal, playing into the ties between music and music videos from the period of this genre. One notable and mildly funny failure of the AI is the leaving of stage-direction notes to itself ("whispered" and "screamed") that were actually said aloud by the backup chorus. Aside from this rather obvious slip-up, the track holds up to scrutiny rather well. Again, the vocals are exclusively male, a pattern seen throughout the vast majority of these tracks.'],
                ['Hip Hop', 'Rise to the Top', 'hip hop, boom bap beats, male rap, gritty flow', 'https://file.aisonggenerator.ai/23337f50-bf3a-4b17-bf86-89b1f1b5804c.mp3', 'https://file.aisonggenerator.ai/e8643413-1292-4298-bcbc-b0c6d71357bd.mp3', 'The main verses fit well with the vocal expectations of rap, but the sections with the chorus are a bit more smooth and melodic than might be expected. In the instrumental sections, there are some <i>very</i> low notes, an interesting quality given the importance of quality high-volume audio equipment within Hip-Hop musical culture. There is a similar issue to the Heavy Metal and Punk genres, with the lyrics being rather generic and not explicitly calling out any <i>real</i> imagery to underline the music. And of course there is the general lack of explicatives, which is possible but not incredibly common within Hip Hop. There are understanbaly some limits on what the AI will produce in this regard.'],
                ['Contemporary Rock', 'Edge of the Night', 'contemporary rock, electric guitars, driving drums, powerful male vocals', 'https://file.aisonggenerator.ai/3a46f94d-7812-433a-b73b-bee14665da45.mp3', 'https://file.aisonggenerator.ai/2b410637-dff4-46a2-874c-4d44f2c9bba2.mp3', 'There is definitely an allegiance to rock in these versions, with effective use of an electric guitar, as well as a drum rhythm which is both steady and steadily increasing in intensity over the course of each verse - a rather precise balance. The instrumental prelude to the second version is rather long, as though leaving space for imagery in a music video. Lyrically, there is a cohesive set of imagery, with repeated visualization of the title "Edge of the Night" as a liminal space from various perspectives. Even though the collection of perspectives is somewhat a conglomerate, the use of slightly more concrete imagery in the chorus grants a reasonably strong cohesion to the verses.'],
                ['Pop', 'Dancing in the Moonlight', 'bright pop beats, catchy synths, uplifting vocals, radio-friendly hooks', 'https://file.aisonggenerator.ai/7ec63162-a40b-433b-94c6-c12d342b08fc.mp3', 'https://file.aisonggenerator.ai/1dadb717-0eb7-4404-b754-31f29559187a.mp3', 'The synthesized tones successfully give this song a "brightness," as requested by the tags. One confusing tag is the one "radio-friendly hooks." What exactly would make a <i>hook</i> radio-friendly? Regardless, it is clear that the context of pop as disseminated over consumption methods such as radio is understood at least by the text-generation algorithm. It is interesting that the singer is male in both cases, when the most significant figures of the pop genre are almost exclusively female. The vocals do not stick to a consistent melody throughout the songs, undermining the "catchiness" of the tune - this is another aspect successfully picked out as important by the text-generation algorithm, but executed with only limited success.'],

        <h1>Echoes of Ourselves<br><small style="font-size:50%">MUSC-208 Final Project<br>Benjamin Whitsett</small></h1>
        <hr width="50%">
        <p>We trace much of the contemporary musical culture back to genres which started in the 1900s. Each such genre came to embody a collection of tropes, images, and stereotypes specific to the genre, and one does not often stop to think about these stereotypes. With the age of generative AI upon us, we now have a sort of acoustic mirror: AI-generated music may either adhere to or deviate from musical stereotypes, having been trained on enormous datasets of existing music. Through analysing how these machine-made songs relate to the themes and tropes we expect, we learn more about ourselves and what expectations we hold.</p>
        <p>For each of the below genres, the AiSongGenerator extension <a href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6788dc42234c81918ae79636c5725f51-ai-music-maker" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"AI Music Maker"</a> for ChatGPT was given a prompt: "Create a [genre] song." The chatbot replied with lyrics and a link to the <a href="https://aisonggenerator.ai/create" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AiSongGenerator</a> page with various "tags" preset for music generation. One set of lyrics was produced for each genre, and two similar renditions of each song were provided by the audio-creation model. Both of these audio files, along with the lyrics to them, are provided in each case. I have also provided some commentary on each genre's rendition - recognizing the AI was overly stereotypical (the lead singer is almost always male), was so stereotypical it actually sounded right (as with the country tracks), or interpreted the genre differently than we may have expected (as with the blues), tying our expectations back to attain a deeper understanding of the assumptions we make about music from these genres.</p>
